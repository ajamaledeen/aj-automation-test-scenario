**The most important User Journeys**

Users should be able to:
> 1. Access the website by entering the URL and land on the home page.
> 1. Navigate to the Products tab, browse listed products, and add items to the cart.
> 1. Proceed to checkout, review the cart, and place an order.
> 1. Register as a new user.
> 1. Log in with valid credentials.
> 1. Log out securely.

Journeys picked for automation script
> 1. Log in
> 1. Search for products and add them to the cart
> 1. Place an order
> 1. Pay and confirm order

Since this is a commercial website, the above are the most important user journeys because they are the revenue generating journeys for any e.commerce business. Automating these user journeys enhances software reliability, increases confidence, and minimizes risks as well as improves business revenues.

### Chosen framework and programming language

For this project I intend to use Selenium WebDrive with Java because of the following reasons:
> 1. Selenium is a free open-source tool and Java is also free and widely used in enterprise applications
> 2. Selenium supports all major browsers and works across different operating systems
> 3. Java has a large developer community and extensive documentation
> 4. Selenium supports cross-browser testing and advanced locators such as XPath, CSS Selectors, ID, Class and LinkText. It also works with cloud-based testing solutions like BrowserStack.
